Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.\n","\n","In this project, you have been tasked with creating a data pipeline for the analysis of supply and demand around the holidays, along with conducting a preliminary analysis of the data. You will be working with two data sources: grocery sales and complementary data. You have been provided with the `grocery_sales` table in `PostgreSQL` database with the following features:\n","\n","# `grocery_sales`\n","\n","-   `\"index\"` - unique ID of the row\n","-   `\"Store_ID\"` - the store number\n","-   `\"Date\"` - the week of sales\n","-   `\"Weekly_Sales\"` - sales for the given store\n","\n","Also, you have the `extra_data.parquet` file that contains complementary data:\n","\n","# `extra_data.parquet`\n","\n","-   `\"IsHoliday\"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.\n","-   `\"Temperature\"` - Temperature on the day of sale\n","-   `\"Fuel_Price\"` - Cost of fuel in the region\n","-   `\"CPI\"` â€“ Prevailing consumer price index\n","-   `\"Unemployment\"` - The prevailing unemployment rate\n","-   `\"MarkDown1\"`, `\"MarkDown2\"`, `\"MarkDown3\"`, `\"MarkDown4\"` - number of promotional markdowns\n","-   `\"Dept\"` - Department Number in each store\n","-   `\"Size\"` - size of the store\n","-   `\"Type\"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)\n","\n","You will need to merge those files and perform some data manipulations. The transformed DataFrame can then be stored as the `clean_data` variable containing the following columns:\n","\n","-   `\"Store_ID\"`\n","-   `\"Month\"`\n","-   `\"Dept\"`\n","-   `\"IsHoliday\"`\n","-   `\"Weekly_Sales\"`\n","-   `\"CPI\"`\n","-   \"`\"Unemployment\"`\"\n","\n","After merging and cleaning the data, you will have to analyze monthly sales of Walmart and store the results of your analysis as the `agg_data` variable that should look like:\n","\n","| Month | Weekly_Sales |\n","| ----- | ------------ |\n","| 1.0   | 33174.178494 |\n","| 2.0   | 34333.326579 |\n","| ...   | ...          |\n","\n","Finally, you should save the `clean_data` and `agg_data` as the csv files.\n","\n","It is recommended to use `pandas` for this project.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"59fe49dc-cda5-4d22-bb10-49e94cdb6437","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"grocery_sales","executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":4087,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true,"source_hidden":false},"lastExecutedAt":1722660875613,"lastExecutedByKernel":"1c126c4d-4c81-435e-ae08-5ce293b15fe6","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"-- Write your SQL query here\nSELECT * FROM grocery_sales","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":45,"type":"dataFrame"}},"sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","type":"integration"}},"outputs":[{"ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (3730367944.py, line 1)","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[1;36m  Cell \u001b[1;32mIn[2], line 1\u001b[1;36m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;33m    SELECT * FROM grocery_sales\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;37m                  ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[1;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}],"source":["SELECT * FROM grocery_sales"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c0d64ff1-a4ca-4a82-a8b4-e210244dedc1","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":585,"lastExecutedAt":1722660876198,"lastExecutedByKernel":"1c126c4d-4c81-435e-ae08-5ce293b15fe6","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Solution code\n\n# Paste the following SQL query into the SQL code cell without the leading # symbol:\n# SELECT * FROM grocery_sales\n\n\n# Paste the following Python code into the Python code cell:\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n# Create the extract() function with two parameters: one for the store data and the other one for the extra data\n# Read the extra data from the parquet file and merge the DataFrames using \"index\" column\ndef extract(store_data, extra_data):\n    extra_df = pd.read_parquet(extra_data)\n    merged_df = store_data.merge(extra_df, on = \"index\")\n    return merged_df\n\n\n# Call the extract() function and store it as the \"merged_df\" variable\nmerged_df = extract(grocery_sales, \"extra_data.parquet\")\n\n# Create the transform() function with one parameter: \"raw_data\"\ndef transform(raw_data):\n  # Fill NaNs using mean since we are dealing with numeric columns\n  # Set inplace = True to do the replacing on the current DataFrame\n    raw_data.fillna(\n      {\n          'CPI': raw_data['CPI'].mean(),\n          'Weekly_Sales': raw_data['Weekly_Sales'].mean(),\n          'Unemployment': raw_data['Unemployment'].mean(),\n      }, inplace = True\n    )\n\n    # Define the type of the \"Date\" column and its format\n    raw_data[\"Date\"] = pd.to_datetime(raw_data[\"Date\"], format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n    # Extract the month value from the \"Date\" column to calculate monthly sales later on\n    raw_data[\"Month\"] = raw_data[\"Date\"].dt.month\n\n    # Filter the entire DataFrame using the \"Weekly_Sales\" column.
