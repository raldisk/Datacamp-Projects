Project Description
Mastering data pipelines is essential for Data Engineers today. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading data â€” a fundamental task that ensures information flows smoothly.

In this project, you will work with retail data from a multinational retail corporation Walmart. You will retrieve data from different sources, like SQL and parquet; prepare the data using some transformation techniques, and finally load the data in an easy-to-access format.
