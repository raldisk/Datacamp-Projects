Project Description
In this project, you'll build reusable Python functions to power an intergalactic delivery startup. You'll practice formatting timestamps and breaking code into reusable parts. These functions will help estimate arrivals, calculate landing times, and update customers across the galaxy. Blast off into space and keep deliveries on time with Python!
