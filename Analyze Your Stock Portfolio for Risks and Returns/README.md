Project Description
When deciding on asset allocation, you can use modern portfolio theory (MPT). MPT emphasizes that you should consider both the expected return and the associated risk (variance) when constructing portfolios.

In this project, you will find and evaluate a set of portfolios using mean-variance optimization using libraries such as PyPortfolioOpt.
