Project Description
Major League Baseball collects the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players using a technology called Statcast. Use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, who played for the New York Yankees. The dataset used in this project is from Baseball Savant.
