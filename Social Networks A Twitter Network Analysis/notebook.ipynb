You'll get hands-on with real Twitter follower data using Pandas, transforming it into a cool directed graph with NetworkX. Along the way, you'll learn how to spot key influencers, find out who follows who, and discover mutual connections between users.\n","\n","### The Data\n","\n","# twitter-followers.csv\n","\n","| Column       | Description                     |\n","| ------------ | ------------------------------- |\n","| `'FOLLOWER'` | id of the user who is following |\n","| `'FOLLOWEE'` | id of the user being followed   |\n","\n","Throughout the project, you will manipulate and organize this data to extract meaningful insights.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"id":"b7f2e82b-2acb-4a77-b073-07e6bad98c96","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":6685,"lastExecutedAt":1722615812677,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6e4e8a8a-0a69-4f6d-9673-6f254045a6e0","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Imports you'll need for the project\nimport pandas as pd\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Load csv data and store as edgelist (a directed graph)\ndf = pd.read_csv('twitter-followers.csv')\nT = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, 'FOLLOWER', 'FOLLOWEE', create_using=nx.DiGraph())\n\n# Display head of the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":143,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["   FOLLOWER  FOLLOWEE\n","0         1         2\n","1         1         3\n","2         1         4\n","3         1         5\n","4         1         6\n"]}],"source":["# Imports you'll need for the project\n","import pandas as pd\n","import networkx as nx\n","\n","# Load csv data and store as edgelist (a directed graph)\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"twitter-followers.csv\")\n","T = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, \"FOLLOWER\", \"FOLLOWEE\", create_using=nx.DiGraph())\n","\n","# Display head of the DataFrame\n","print(df.head())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"15f29392-1cc4-4276-bc51-c52c42ad796e","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":53,"lastExecutedAt":1722615812730,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6e4e8a8a-0a69-4f6d-9673-6f254045a6e0","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Start coding here and use as many cells as you need!\n\n# Returns True is user_id2 is following user_id1\ndef is_following(T, user_id1, user_id2):\n    return user_id1 in T.neighbors(user_id2)\n    \n# Returns a list of user ids that are following at least min_following_count other users\ndef get_users_following_min_accounts(T, min_following_count):\n    return [node for node in T.nodes() if len(list(T.neighbors(node))) >= min_following_count]\n\n# Returns a list of user ids that user_id1 and user_id2 both follow\ndef get_mutual_followees(T, user_id1, user_id2):\n    #
