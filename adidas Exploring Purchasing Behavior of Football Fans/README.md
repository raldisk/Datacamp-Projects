Project Description
Join the data team at adidas as EURO 2024 approaches! With excitement building, adidas seeks to leverage data-driven insights to fine-tune its marketing strategies and product lines, specifically targeting football enthusiasts. Your task is to utilize Python and SQL to sift through the provided adidas datasets to extract valuable insights about football fan behavior, preferences, and engagement.

This project explores some of the following questions:

How are football fans different to our total consumers in terms of characteristics and demographics?
How much Net Sales were generated by our Football Fans in 2022 in the football category? What were the top product types and top key categories that football fans purchased outside of the football category?
At which touchpoints did our football fans in GB engage in Q4 2022?
What are the top 3 engagement types that precede a purchase?
Don't worry if you find some of the tasks in this project beyond your current capabilities. The goal here is to learn, have fun, and apply your skills to a real-life scenario. If at any point you are stuck, you can revisit the adidas Custom Tracks to review the prerequisite courses, and return to this project.
