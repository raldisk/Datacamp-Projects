It's your job to write these custom functions to check all user inputs to ensure they meet minimum criteria before account creation to reduce crashes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"id":"37988e6b-da88-4ca4-846c-06d7f8e7d740","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":53,"lastExecutedAt":1722489792291,"lastExecutedByKernel":"1014c1fb-d245-4319-85ee-1c66c876497b","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell\n# Preloaded data for validating email domain.\ntop_level_domains = [\n    \".org\",\n    \".net\",\n    \".edu\",\n    \".ac\",\n    \".gov\",\n    \".com\",\n    \".io\"\n]"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Re-run this cell\n","# Preloaded data for validating email domain.\n","top_level_domains = [\".org\", \".net\", \".edu\", \".ac\", \".gov\", \".com\", \".io\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"178a7c62-d560-467e-8b64-c434db4eb255","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":null,"lastExecutedAt":null,"lastExecutedByKernel":null,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":143,"type":"stream"}}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["True\n","False\n","False\n","True\n","False\n","False\n"]}],"source":["# Implement the function to validate the name.\n","def validate_name(name):\n","    # Check that the datatype of the variable is what is expected (a string).\n","    if type(name) != str:\n","        return False\n","    # Check if the name is less than or equal to two characters long, if so return False.\n","    elif len(name) <= 2:\n","        return False\n","    # Name passed all checks, return True.\n","    else:\n","        return True\n","\n","\n","# Implement the function to validate the email.\n","def validate_email(email):\n","    # Check that the datatype of the variable is what is expected (a string).\n","    if type(email) != str:\n","        return False\n","    # If the email does not include the @ symbol return False.\n","    if \"@\" not in email:\n","        return False\n","    # Loop through domain strings in the top_level_domains list.\n","    for domain in top_level_domains:\n","        # Check if the domain is included in the email.\n","        if email.endswith(domain):\n","            # If the domain is in the email, return a boolean with a value of True.\n","            return True\n","    # If code reaches this point, domain did not match, so return False to indicate invalid email\n","    return False\n","\n","\n","# Test cases\n","print(validate_name(\"John\"))\n","print(validate_name(\"A\"))\n","print(validate_name(123))\n","\n","print(validate_email(\"john@example.com\"))\n","print(validate_email(\"john@example.xyz\"))\n","print(validate_email(\"johnexample.com\"))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
